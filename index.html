      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p id="first_paragraph">Zen Bridge is a non-for-profit mental health organization committed to helping individuals
        through their mental
        health
        journey.
        Whether you're someone who has had therapy sessions in the past, or taking your very first step, you've come to
        the right place.
        Our <strong>mission</strong> is to provide a compassionate, educative, and engaging space where people can find
        the resources they need to navigate life’s challenges. Your mental health shouldn't have to wait, so we
        provide services that allow you to take action right when you need it.</p>

      <aside>
        <blockquote>&#10077;In a 2019 survey of working Canadians, 75% said they would be reluctant/refuse to disclose a
          mental illness to an employer or co-worker due to the fear of being judged, and consequences of losing their
          job.&#10078;
        </blockquote>
      </aside>

      <p>The founder created Zen Bridge after facing his own challenges in overcoming a significant problem in his
        mental health. He recalls the hardest part was taking the first leap due to his fear in speaking to someone
        about his mental health.</p>

      <p>That's why our <strong>vision</strong> at Zen Bridge is to help eliminate this stigma. We understand that we
        are all in a different spectrum when it comes to sharing our experiences.
        That's why we built this inclusive community where people support each other in their mental health journey in a
        pace that works for them and where support given when it's needed.</p>

      <p>Whether you're looking for guidance for yourself or seeking ways to support others, Zen Bridge is here to help.
        We believe in the power of community, and our goal is to create an inclusive, non-judgmental space where
        everyone can find the support they need to thrive. Together, we can break the stigma around mental health and
        help individuals lead happier, healthier lives.</p>

      <p>Zen Bridge is more than just a resource—it's a place of healing, empowerment, and connection.</p>

  <p>“Perhaps the biggest tragedy of our lives is that freedom is possible, yet we can pass our years trapped in the
    same old patterns...We may want to love other people without holding back, to feel authentic, to breathe in the
    beauty around us, to dance and sing. Yet each day we listen to inner voices that keep our life small.”
