    <p id="first_paragraph">At Zen Bridge, we recognize the profound impact that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can have on
      individuals and their families. PTSD is a mental health condition that can occur following exposure to a traumatic
      experience. Current treatments include psychological therapies (e.g., exposure-based interventions) and
      pharmacological treatments (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)). However, a significant
      proportion of patients receiving standard-of-care therapies for PTSD remain symptomatic, and new approaches for
      this and other trauma-related mental health conditions are greatly needed.</p>

    <p>As part of our holistic approach at Zen Bridge, we offer a variety of counseling services that address the unique
      needs of individuals dealing with PTSD. Our professional counselors specialize in evidence-based therapies and
      integrate alternative approaches to healing trauma. Psychedelic compounds that alter cognition, perception, and
      mood are currently being examined for their efficacy in treating PTSD despite their current status as Drug
      Enforcement Administration (DEA)-scheduled substances. Initial clinical trials have demonstrated the potential
      value of psychedelic-assisted therapy to treat PTSD and other psychiatric disorders.</p>

    <p>At Zen Bridge, we are committed to staying informed about emerging treatments for PTSD, including those that may
      one day become more widely available. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the state of the science of PTSD
      clinical care, including current treatments and their shortcomings. We review clinical studies of psychedelic
      interventions to treat PTSD, trauma-related disorders, and common comorbidities. The classic psychedelics
      psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and DMT-containing ayahuasca, as
      well as the entactogen 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and the dissociative anesthetic ketamine, are
      reviewed.</p>

    <p>For each drug, we present the history of use, psychological and somatic effects, pharmacology, and safety
      profile. The rationale and proposed mechanisms for use in treating PTSD and trauma-related disorders are
      discussed. This review concludes with an in-depth consideration of future directions for the psychiatric
      applications of psychedelics to maximize therapeutic benefit and minimize risk in individuals and communities
      impacted by trauma-related conditions.</p>

    <p>At Zen Bridge, we strive to offer an inclusive, supportive space where individuals impacted by trauma can explore
      different avenues of healing. While we do not currently offer psychedelic-assisted therapy, our counseling
      services are grounded in proven therapeutic methods that provide relief and help clients build resilience. We are
      always seeking to expand our knowledge and resources to serve those in need, and we encourage individuals book a
      free consultation for more information on PTSD counselling and support services.</p>
